## üöÄ What's PhysiXplorer?

PhysiXplorer is an **open-source project** designed to provide high school and university students with interactive, easy-to-understand physics simulations. Built with the latest web technologies, PhysiXplorer lets you explore various physics phenomena through **interactive animations** that you control. It's all about **learning by doing**, and every simulation is designed to let you visualize the physics behind it. 

From **simple pendulums** to **electric circuits**, our simulations are created using the powerful **p5.js** library, and we encourage everyone to contribute, no matter if you're a physics expert or just starting. Ready to **explore**, **experiment**, and **learn**? Let's go!

## üéÆ Features

- **Interactive Simulations:** Play around with simulations on topics like motion, waves, energy, and more!
- **Customizable Parameters:** Tweak variables and see real-time changes in the simulation. You control the experiment!
- **Educational Theories:** Each simulation comes with an accompanying **theory section**, explaining the underlying physics and math in a fun, digestible format. 
- **Easy-to-use Interface:** Clean, intuitive design so that you can focus on exploring, not figuring out how to use it.

## ‚ö° How It Works

### Set Up the Project
PhysiXplorer is built using **ExpressJS**, a fast web framework for Node.js. To get started, simply follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js** ‚Äì The project is built with Node.js, and npm (Node Package Manager) will take care of the dependencies.
2. **Run the Setup** ‚Äì In the terminal, run `npm install` to install all the required node modules.

### Adding a New Simulation
Have a cool physics simulation in mind? We made it super easy to contribute your own:

1. **Add your p5.js simulation**: Drop your code in the `/public/javascripts/` folder.
2. **Provide Simulation Data**: Update the `/routes/parameters/simulationdata.js` with your new simulation's data.
3. **Run the Python Script**: Run the `python addSimulation.py` script to add your simulation to the site.

Don't worry ‚Äì if you're not sure where to start, we've got **tutorials** and **starter examples** like the **simplePendulum.js** simulation that you can fork and build upon!

## üî• Theming and UI

We‚Äôve designed the site with simplicity and clarity in mind. The UI ensures that all the important controls, like **sliders, buttons, and dropdowns**, are easily accessible, but only when you need them. The simulation window and theory section are organized neatly to ensure a clean learning experience.

### Customization is Key
Every simulation has its own customizable settings. Want to change the mass of the pendulum or the length of the string? It's just a few clicks away! Each setting allows you to change the physics in real time and understand how different parameters affect the system.
